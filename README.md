# Welcome to my GitHub world! 

I grew up in the heart of the Gobi Desert in northwest of China, where I learned to be adaptive, persistent, and humble from an early age.

I built a strong academic foundation in mathematics during my college and graduate studies at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). There, I started program with Assembly, C/C++, and Fortran languages. The application was to perform large scale numerical analysis to calculate stress and strain distribution in complext structures. In fact, I wrote more code during this time than I did when pursing my Master's degree of computer science at [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu). 

With [experience spanning over 17 years of in software development, more than a decade in cybersecurity, and 7+ years in management](https://github.com/therightwei/aboutme/blob/main/introduction.md), I have honed a unique blend of technical expertise and leadership skills in software development and security. My diverse background and relentless drive have empowered me to navigate complex challenges and innovate in the ever-evolving technology landscape.

Beyond technology, I practice Tai Chi and am an avid golfer. I have been a dedicated Tai Chi practitioner for over 30 years, specializing in the traditional Chen style, which holds rich styles and a long history compared to the more popular styles. I consider golf the "Tai Chi" in ball sports because Tai Chi and golf follow the same principles of balance, focus, and controlled movement, which have contributed to my life success.

Thank you for your interest! I hope you enjoy the life as much as I do!
